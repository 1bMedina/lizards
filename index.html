        <h1>Common Lizard Species</h1>
        <p>
            There are many lizards species that people keep as pets. For example, beginners in lizard care usually have bearded dragons, leopard geckos and crested geckos. For more advanced lizard care takers, they may have day geckos, chameleons, or chinese water dragons.
